Harvardx Capstone Final Project

Title: VideoGame Sales

Data set Source: https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales"

Objective: The Video Games project is part of the HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course. The aim of the project 
is to develop and train recommendation machine learning algorithms to predict North American video game sales from 
a set of video games spanning the years 1985 to 2016 in the data set. The Residual Mean Square Error (RMSE) will be used to 
evaluate the accuracy of the algorithms. This report will present methods used in exploratory data analysis and visualization, 
results for the RMSE model and a conclusion based on results of the model. The objective is to demonstrate knowledge acquired in 
the 9 courses of the professional certificate.

The Video Games Sales data set is in csv format. The code separated the data into two subsets for training (train_set) and testing 
(test_set). The algorithms used to train and test the model were Naive Bayes, Generalised Linear Model (GLM), K-nearest neighbor (Knn), 
Random Forest, and Classification Trees, The data set was loaded as a data frame.
